# 🛒 Retail Intelligence Platform

A **Retail Intelligence Platform** designed to analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and operational metrics to support **data-driven decision-making** in modern retail businesses. This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning concepts can be applied to real-world retail problems.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Retail organizations generate large volumes of transactional and customer data, but most of it remains underutilized. Decision-making is often reactive rather than predictive.

The **Retail Intelligence Platform** addresses this gap by providing:

* Sales performance analysis
* Customer behavior insights
* Product-level trend identification
* Actionable dashboards for business stakeholders

This repository represents a **practical analytics-focused platform**, suitable for academic evaluation and portfolio presentation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze historical retail sales data
* Identify high-performing and underperforming products
* Understand customer purchase patterns
* Enable business insights through visual analytics
* Build a scalable foundation for predictive modeling
